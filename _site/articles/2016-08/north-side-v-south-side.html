    <h2 id="its-the-ultimate-show-down">IT’S THE ULTIMATE SHOW DOWN..</h2>
<p>Jets vs. Sharks. Biggie vs. Pac. and now… North Campus vs. Central Campus. Quantified.</p>

<p>If you didn’t go to the University of Michigan or never cared to attend any of your engineering classes, then let me inform you of the rivalry underlying much of the angst that comes with heaping amounts of student debt, cramming for exams, and getting involved in way too many extra curriculars because well, everyone else is.</p>

<p>North Campus sprung from a need for the university to accommodate its burgeoning student population. Taken from the University of Michigan Millennial Project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Space on the University of Michigan campus became inadequate to accommodate the post-war growth of the University. In anticipation of this growing need, the Regents had begun to acquire farmland property on the sloping hills lying just to the northeast of the Huron River. Although there were some early thoughts given to relocating the School of Education, Natural Resources, Music, and Fine Arts to the North Campus, the construction of the Phoenix Memorial Project soon re-purposed the site for engineering research. More specifically, the early plans for the North Campus included the Cooley Memorial Laboratory to house the electronics research associated with the Willow Run Laboratories, the Phoenix Memorial Laboratory, the Automotive Laboratory, and a storage library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today North Campus houses the engineering campus including classrooms and a research facility, the School of Art and Architecture, the School of Information, and the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance. Also many unfortunate and forever-looked-down-upon freshmen are placed into the 3rd biggest residential hall in the country, Burseley Hall, more often known as the “Dirty Burs”.</p>

<p>For many, this is where the bitter contempt starts. Missing out on 15 minutes of sleep due to an always cramped bus ride to Central, the worst dining hall food on campus, and late night Ubers or SafeRides back to a lonely, far off dorm room in the boondocks of the student population (it’s October and you need to be looking for a place on Central already for next Fall).</p>

<p>But for engineers, artists, and the musically inclined, it is likely to be a place akin to home for four years. Late nights in the Dude, the 24 hour library and nap-place-of-choice for many, will become nostalgic pastimes. Some of the best minds in academia do their work in the research centers here, a place which forms the proving ground for ideas that will go on to be the central intellectual property of future Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p>And basically everything else is on Central campus, including the largest football stadium in the country, dirty college dive bars posing as sports bars, Saturday morning tailgates, activist gatherings, Blank Slate ice cream, and everything else indicative of a healthy social life.</p>

<p>I wanted to put the $600 tracking device that I carry around on my body all day to some good use for once, so I decided to compare the data I’ve been collecting through the Moves app using this quantification jewel called Zenobase. Zenobase imports, collects, and stores data that you tell it to, and you can do some pretty cool and simple visualizations with it. It took a late Saturday night but I was able to graph some data on my North Campus vs. Central Campus habits.</p>

<p>Theoretically I should be spending about a third of my time on North, with engineering classes, work and projects. I compared two months with full datasets, August and September. There are three figures for each, with North being in orange and Central in blue. The top figure is the duration for each day over the month, the left is the time for each day of the week (plotted for Mon-Fri since there is no reason I should be on North on the weekend…barring feelings of loneliness and separation with my engineering kiln), and the right is the hourly spread.</p>

<p>In August I was working in a lab in EECS from 9-5. Not surprisingly work took up most of the day and is represented in the day of the week spread on the left. Your welcome NSA I’m doing your job for you.</p>

<p>For September I’m actually a bit surprised at how much I tended to be on Central, because it feels like I’m usually in EECS 1220 until at least 10 every night. Soon with more data I’ll be able to correlate location with type of work, whether I work on Electromagnetics in 1220, Hatcher, or the BBB more. Currently I’m using the Apple Watch I won at Mhacks(!!) with the Hours app to track how much time I spend on each class. Then maybe instead of telling me to stand up each hour my watch will tell me that I should be working on my Data Structures project.</p>
