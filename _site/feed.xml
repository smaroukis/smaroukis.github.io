        <title>Southern Comfort Food at Foster Falls</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/foster_falls/ff_cover.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was itching to get back outside to climb on some real rock ever since my first outdoor trip to the Red River Gorge in October ‘16. We originally planned on going back to the Red in January, but winter finally decided to show up so we pushed the trip a few hours further to Tennessee. Having grown up outside of Chattanooga between the ages of 4 and 12, I had no idea how much good climbing there was in the surrounding area. After a weekend though I had a new moniker stuck in my head, “Foster Falls ain’t no joke!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat Steel was our guidebook. It is awesome. Generally I felt the routes were a harder than the Red, and even on the 7’s and 8’s you had to do a lot of sighting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;routes&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did mostly routes around the 5.10 level, some of the classics were (rating as out of &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narcissim&lt;/em&gt; (@ Diehydrals), 5.10b ***&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hurts So Good&lt;/em&gt; (@ Paradox Wall), 5.10a ***&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mammplitude&lt;/em&gt; (@ Red Light District), 5.10a **&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miss Prissy &amp;amp; Miss Scarlet&lt;/em&gt; (@ Lower Jimmy), 5.9 **
an Unmarked 5.9+/5.10a @ Lower Jimmy (all the way to the left) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the Foster Falls campground, which was right by the trail leading to the crag, which was a long L shaped continuous wall that took more than an hour to walk all of.&lt;/p&gt;
