        <title>Southern Comfort Food at Foster Falls</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was itching to get back outside to climb on some real rock ever since my first outdoor trip to the Red River Gorge in October ‘16. We originally planned on going back to the Red in January, but winter finally decided to show up so we pushed the trip a few hours further to Tennessee. Having grown up outside of Chattanooga between the ages of 4 and 12, I had no idea how much good climbing there was in the surrounding area. After a weekend though I had a new moniker stuck in my head, “Foster Falls ain’t no joke!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat Steel was our guidebook. It is awesome. Generally I felt the routes were a harder than the Red, and even on the 7’s and 8’s you had to do a lot of route finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;routes&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did mostly routes around the 5.10 level, some of the classics were (rating as out of &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narcissim&lt;/em&gt; (@ Diehydrals), 5.10b ***&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hurts So Good&lt;/em&gt; (@ Paradox Wall), 5.10a ***&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mammplitude&lt;/em&gt; (@ Red Light District), 5.10a **&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miss Prissy &amp;amp; Miss Scarlet&lt;/em&gt; (@ Lower Jimmy), 5.9 **
an Unmarked 5.9+/5.10a @ Lower Jimmy (all the way to the left)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the Foster Falls campground, which was right by the trail leading to the crag, which was a long L shaped continuous wall that took more than an hour to walk all of.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mt. Ritter Summit - Ansel Adams Wilderness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/2016/ansel_adams/cover.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to undergo my first true mountaineering experience with two weekends left in summer internship at Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric. It was a weekend trip to Ansel Adams wilderness, with epitomic views of the High Sierras and idyllic lakeside camping. We hiked in 6 miles to camp at Ediza Lake and the next day undertook the class 3 climb to the top of Mount Ritter (3,700ft elevation change over 3 miles, 13,143 ft summit).  The access to wilderness in California is unprecedented, and if you’re willing to drive 4.5 hours after work on a Friday, you’ll be rewarded with weekend memories that last a lifetime. (shoutout to Ryan and Aaron for letting my pass out in the  back of the car as they drove both ways).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mt. Ritter sits on the edge of Ansel Adams wilderness, the historic photographer that was famous for his black and white prints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/2016/ansel_adams/ryan-lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ryan's BW photo of the lake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan woke up early and took some Ansel-inspired pictures of Ediza lake and the Minarets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/2016/ansel_adams/ryan-minarets.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ryan BW Minarets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we set off for a big day – three miles to the summit, then 9 more back down all the way to the trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few miles were meandering up the meadows towards the base of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are some waterfall scrambles on tight precipices, but it is only class 2 or 3. Soon you start to feel very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt; Looking back at the moraines below. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is mention of a frog looking structure. Once you go around that you should see the scree-filled gully that shoots up to the peak. It’s steep, and the rock is crumbly, but it’s maybe 4th class at most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/2016/ansel_adams/scree1.JPG&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt; The scree field heads around the corner up and to the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was still some snow left, albeit rotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top, it is hard not to feel like you’re on top of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit, looking out at the whole of Ansel Adams Wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
