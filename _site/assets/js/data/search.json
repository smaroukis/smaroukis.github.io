The knee point is not the point of saturation — the point of saturation corresponds to a volt-time area since the flux is given by the integration of the voltage waveform. Although it is desired to operate in the linear region below the knee, where the excitation current is small compared to the current through the secondary burden, CTs often operate beyond this knee point for relaying applications due to asymmetrical fault currents, remanence flux, and design constraints. The knee point is not the point of saturation — the point of saturation corresponds to a volt-time area since the flux is given by the integration of the voltage waveform.Current Transformer TheoryTransformers operate on the fundamental principle that a time-varying magnetic flux induces a voltage to oppose it (Faraday’s Law). A current through a primary winding creates a magnetic field (H-field) which induces an amount of flux depending on the magnetic properties of the material, the excitation level and the number of turns of coil around the secondary. Note: load must be connected for current to flow. Never open circuit a CT.Example flux paths of a time varying current of a primary winding inducing a secondary current.\\[e=N\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\]When a load (normally called a “burden”) is connected to this secondary voltage, a current will flow. How well this secondary current is an exact replication of the primary current depends on the level of excitation. At low excitation values all of the current is used to develop the core’s magnetic field and at high excitation values the core can saturate.The magnetic atoms in the magnetic core material react in a non-linear fashion when an H-field is applied, since they can only “line-up” so much in one direction. This results in the familiar B-H curve showing magnetic flux density vs. magnetic field intensity. The Flux-Magnetizing Current curve has the same shape since it is the magnetizing current driving the H-field and the flux also includes the proportional affect of the area of the magnetic core. This curve will be different for varying levels of excitation.Also note that \\(d\\phi/dI\\) represents the magnetizing inductance of the core.The B-H curve of a current transformer core for varying levels of excitation1.To understand the above graph we need the equivalent circuit of the current transformer.Equivalent CircuitEquivalent circuit of current transformer. Note the exciting branch is made up of a varying reactive magnetizing impedance and resistive losses.Since the primary turns is 1, the burden appears on the primary as a very small impedance ($Z_B’=Z_B \\cdot 1/N_2^2$)Clearly not all current is delivered to the burden (which is what we can measure, and what our relays “see”). The ratio correction factor (RCF) is used to correct the secondary current for this non-ideal case.Above we can see the variable magnetizing impedance. At low excitation levels \\(d\\phi / dI = L\\) is low, so the majority of the total secondary current ($I_{ST}$) flows over $Z_e$ and not through the burden. At moderate levels of excitation the magnetizing impedance increases and most of the secondary current flows over the burden. At high levels of excitation the impedance flips between an open and a short. This is the saturation region where the secondary current that flows across the burden (which is the only current that we “see”) is not an accurate representation of the primary current.The magnetization current lags the exciting voltage by 90 degrees and the losses are nearly in phase. These two vectors give the excitation current.Simplifying the equivalent circuit above, the secondary can be represented as a current source from the ideal transformer where $I_{sec}=I_{pri} \\cdot N_1/N_2$. This current is “fixed” depending on the primary current — the excitation voltage will be developed due to the connected burden, secondary resistance and leakage impedance.A simplified secondary CT equivalent with animation of different excitation levels: 1) the current source is a reflection of the primary current 2) since the magnetizing impedance dominates the losses, we just show Zm 3) ) leakage reactance is negligible for Class C CTs. At low excitation (green), the majority of current flows through the small magnetizing impedance to generate the magnetic field. At moderate levels of excitation (orange) most of the secondary current flows through the burden. At high levels of excitation (red) the magnetizing impedance switches between an open and a short during different values of the sinusoidal current and resulting B-H curve. An increase in burden impedance at a given current will demand an increase in excitation voltage.Phasor diagram of CT secondary with standard burden of 0.5 power factor (60 degrees). Take the secondary current and add the voltage drop from the leakage reactance and winding impedance. This voltage plus the secondary terminal voltage equals the excitation voltage. The flux and magnetizing current lag this voltage by 90 degrees.2The Volt-Time AreaIntegrating both sides of the flux-voltage equation gives\\[\\phi N=BAN=\\int_0^t v\\cdot dt\\]So the flux can be thought of as the area under the voltage sine wave, known as the volt-time area. There is a value for this volt-time area that corresponds to the saturation flux point. Increased area due to asymmetrical offset or a higher peak can result in the core going above the saturation flux limit.Other things to note: a larger cross sectional area results in an increased volt-time area before saturation from Faraday’s law, an increase in turns reduces the amount of flux necessary to produce a given secondary EMF, which means saturation occurs at a proportionally higher voltage when the number of secondary turns is increasedExcitation Curve and the Knee Point The rating is the voltage the CT can support across a standard burden with 20 times rated current without exceeding 10% ratio correction errorThe excitation curve is a graph of the secondary voltage ($V_e$) vs the excitation current ($I_e$). This shows us what current the burden won’t see for various voltage levels. It is directly related to the magnetizing impedance given by $V_e/I_e$. This also gives us our ratio correction factor.The standard CT excitation curve that manufacturers provide. Here we can read the voltage rating from the excitation voltage at 10A of excitation current. The voltage rating must be less the voltage read off the graph minus the winding and leakage drop, which means that the CT can develop this voltage without exceeding 10A excitation (or 10% error at 100A secondary)3.The “knee point” represents the maximum permeability, or the minimum magnetizing impedance. Since most current will flow through the burden at this point, it is where we want our CT to operate for maximum fault currents.The voltage rating can be taken directly from this since “the rating is the voltage the CT can support across a standard burden with 20 times rated current without exceeding 10% ratio correction error”2. Since 20 times the rated secondary current of 5A equals 100A, a 10% ratio correction error means 10A of shunted excitation current. We can read this secondary voltage corresponding to 10A excitation. This voltage value from the graph minus voltage drop of the winding resistance should be greater than the voltage rating of the CT, meaning that the CT can develop this voltage level without saturating the flux core.For multi-ratio CTs, the ability to develop voltage without saturating is scaled proportionally by the number of turns. Thus for a C400 600:5 CT operating on the 300:5 tap, the new voltage “rating” is 200V.Criterion to Avoid Saturation When the DC offset is at maximum, the CT flux can potentially increase to $1+X/R$ times the flux of the non-offset componentSaturation can occur from both symmetrical and asymmetrical currents on the primary. Symmetrical current waveforms with a large peak can saturate the core within the first cycle. Asymmetrical current waveforms with a DC offset may not saturate in the first cycle, but in the latter cycle since the volt-time area does not cancel out with negative values.The asymmetrical current is due to the X/R system ratio. With the voltage developed by the fault current and the secondary burden, we can develop the criterion to avoid saturation (to stay under the voltage rating of the CT) as4:\\[20 \\ge (\\frac{X}{R}+1)\\cdot I_f \\cdot Z_b\\]We risk saturation if The fault current is higher than 20 times rated current OR The connected burden is higher than standardThis gives the following rule of thumbs: Limit max fault current &lt;100A max on secondary Limit $I_f \\cdot Z_b$ &lt; half the voltage rating of the CT. This allows for DC offset and remanence flux ($I_f$ is maximum symmetrical fault current)CT Ratings, Classes and Other TypesAlmost all CTs used in protective relaying are class C or K C: “Calculated”, negligible leakage flux, excitation curve can be used directly to determine performance, assumed that burden and excitation currents are in phase and that secondary winding is uniformly distributed; ANSI e.g. C100, C200, C400, C800 corresponding to secondary voltages (@100A) of 100V,200V,400V,800V etc and burdens of 1,2,4,8 respectively (due to Z=V/100); ANSI specifies PF of burden at 0.5 (60 degrees); K: same as C + knee-point voltage at least 70% of voltage rating; results in larger core cross section area T: “Test”, ratio error must be determined by test; has appreciable core flux leakage and thus ratio error H,L: old ANSI classifications mostly for CTs manufactured before 1954Other CT typesGapped coresAn air gap can be added to the core which 1) increases magnetizing current and 2) reduces the possibility of remanence. Large-gapped cores are known as linearized cores; the effect is to increase the linear region of the BH curve &amp; decrease the permeability (lower magnetizing impedance).An air gap can be introduce to extend the linear region of the B-H curve at the expense of reduced permeability.Further Reading C57.13-2016: IEEE Standard Requirements for Instrumentation Transformers Moreton, S.

This blog post is the result.The Origins of a DC Offset Asymmetry in fault currents due to the inductive nature of power systems results in higher-than-normal transient conditions that may exceed the interrupting rating of devices or cause saturation of relaying CTs (and thus device mis-operation).Asymmetrical fault currents are AC fault currents with a DC offset that quickly decays to zero. The result is higher than normal fault currents that may exceed the interrupting rating of devices or cause saturation of relaying CTs on protective devices. Asymmetry occurs to some degree in all three-phase faults since all phase currents cannot be 0 at the same time. Conversely, line-to-ground are mostly symmetric, since insulator failure or flashover usually occurs near voltage peaks (zero-current crossing for naturally reactive systems)1. Here we’ll talk about asymmetric currents out on the distribution system, far from a generator, so we won’t be taking into account the generator sub-transient, transient, and steady state impedances. Asymmetry occurs to some degree in all three-phase faults since all three-phase currents cannot be 0 simultaneously.The asymmetry, with respect to the zero axis of the sinusoidal current, arises from the need for currents and voltages to satisfy two rules: Current must lag voltage by the system phase angle (90° for purely reactive systems) Current cannot change instantaneously across an inductance (and both large conductors and large machines are inductive)Asymmetrical current can be broken into both a purely symmetrical AC component and a purely aperiodic DC component. The AC component is symmetrical about the y-axis. The DC component is exponentially decaying with a time constant proportional to X/R. The initial magnitude of the DC current depends on the time of occurrence due to the closing phase angle determined by the offset from the zero-crossing of the voltage waveform and the system phase angle, $\\theta=\\tan^{-1}(X/R)$.The asymmetrical waveform is the sum of the DC and AC components. In a power system, it will develop from zero as shown.Case: Inductive System,Inductive Case: $X»R$, $\\theta \\approx 90°$Conditions for Maximum DC OffsetThe worst case is for a fault occuring near a zero-crossing of the voltage where the closing angle $\\alpha=0$. At this point the current is at a peak, and so an opposing DC current of the same magnitude will be induced. The asymmetric current will then increase until a point when the current sine wave is lagging the voltage by 90°.\\[i_{ac}(t) = \\sqrt{2} I_{ac} sin(\\omega t + \\alpha - \\theta)\\]\\[i_{dc}(t) = I_{dc} e^{-\\omega tR/X}\\]$I_{ac}$, the RMS value of the symmetrical waveform, depends on the type of fault, the pre-fault voltage and equivalent impedance. For three phase faults, $I_{ac} = V/(Z_1+Z_F)$.$I_{dc}$ is the starting value (and maximum) of the DC component. Having no DC voltage to maintain it, the DC component decays with a time constant $ \\tau=\\frac{X/R}{\\omega} =\\frac{L}{R} $. Usually the system X/R value is given, where a larger value will cause a slower decay. IEEE/IEC standards use X/R $=$ 17 ($\\tau =$ 45ms or ~2.7 cycles), which is an expected value near a distribution breaker, but X/R &gt; 50 is not uncommon for a large generator2.Since current cannot change instantaneously in a power system, the range of the maximum DC offset is\\[i_{asym}(t=0)=0 \\\\\\Rightarrow i_{dc}(0) = -i_{ac}(0) \\\\-\\sqrt{2}I_{ac} \\le I_{dc} \\le \\sqrt{2}I_{ac} \\\\\\]In general, for a asymmetric sinsoidal wave with a DC offset of $A_0$ and a purely symmetric peak of $A_1$, the RMS value is equal to3\\[u_{RMS} = \\sqrt{A_0^2 + \\frac{A_1^2}{2}} \\\\= \\sqrt{A_0^2 + A_{1,RMS}^2}\\]thus the maximum RMS value that the asymmetric fault current can obtain is\\[\\displaystyle I_{max, asym} = \\sqrt{(I_{dc}^2 + I_{ac}^2)} \\\\= \\sqrt{3} I_{ac} \\\\= 1.732 \\times I_{ac}\\]Since in reality the DC component will decay during the first half cycle before the asymmetric current reaches its peak,\\[I_{max,asym} \\approx 1.6 \\times I_{ac}\\](this approximation is also shown in the limit of the graph of asymmetric curve factors below)Conditions for No DC OffsetConversely if the fault occurs at a voltage peak (zero current crossing), no offset will develop since the closing angle is equal to the system angle.In fact the full asymmetrical waveform based on the closing ($\\alpha$) and system ($\\theta$) angles is4\\[i_{asym}(t) = I_{ac} (sin(\\omega t + \\alpha - \\theta) - sin(\\alpha - \\theta) e^{-\\omega tR/X})\\]With $\\alpha=\\theta\\approx 90°$,\\[i_{asym}(t) = I_{ac}sin(\\omega t)\\]Equation &amp; Curve of Asymmetric FactorThe Asymmetry Factor, $\\kappa$, can be used to calculate the total asymmetric current from just the symmetric current and the X/R value of the system.\\[\\kappa := \\frac{I_{asym}}{I_{ac}} \\Rightarrow I_{asym} = \\kappa I_{ac}\\]\\[I_{RMS, asym} = \\sqrt{I_{dc}^2 + I_{ac}^2} \\\\= \\sqrt{ I_{ac}^2 + (\\sqrt{2}I_{ac}e^{-\\omega tR/X})^2} \\\\= I_{ac} \\sqrt{1+2e^{-2\\omega t R/X}} \\\\\\Rightarrow \\kappa(t,X,R,\\omega) = \\sqrt{1+2e^{-2\\omega t R/X}}\\]And taking $t=\\text{half cycle}=1/120s$ since the worst case peak value of the asymmetric current would occur a half cycle after the fault occurence,\\[\\kappa(X,R) = \\sqrt{1+2e^{-2\\pi R/X}}\\]The equation as a function of X/R is shown in the interactive graph below.References Zocholl, Stanley E., Analyzing and Applying Current Transformers. &#8617; Yuen, Moon H. “Short Circuit ABC–Learn It in an Hour, Use It Anywhere, Memorize No Formula.” &#8617; https://masteringelectronicsdesign.com/how-to-derive-the-rms-value-of-a-sine-wave-with-a-dc-offset/ &#8617; de Metz-Noblat, Benoit, Frédéric Dumas, and Georges Thomasset. “Calculation of short-circuit currents.” Cahier technique 158 &#8617; " } ]
