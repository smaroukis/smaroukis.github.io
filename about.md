### More Information

I'm an electrical engineer working for the California electric and gas utility Pacific Gas & Electric. As of December 2017 I'm working in their Grid Integration and Innovation group helping to support pilot projects on smart inverters and behind the meter storage. I'm interested in integrating distributed resources onto the grid and what this may mean for design of not-yet-developed power grids. I also like hacking in Python and learning Japanese in my free time. 


#Currently an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Michigan, interested in #power systems, the energy industry, Japan, and hacking on side projects in Python. I help #run a [creatorspace](http://www.creatorspace.co) providing students with a community and #mentorship to work on their passions. I like being [outdoors](http://maroukis.me).
