This website is published/hosted on Github Pages with the [Jekyll Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), which was forked and has minimal edits. 

I'm open to feedback, so create a pull request for corrections, comments, or typos. 

My publishing workflow also includes some markdown preprocessing scripts which are hosted at https://github.com/smaroukis/obsidian-to-jekyll.
