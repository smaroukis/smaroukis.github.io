> Asymmetry in fault currents due to the inductive nature of power systems results in higher-than-normal transient conditions that may exceed the interrupting rating of devices or cause saturation of relaying CTs (and thus device misoperation).

Asymmetrical fault currents are AC fault currents with a DC offset that quickly decays to zero. The result is higher than normal fault currents that may exceed the interrupting rating of devices or cause saturation of relaying CTs on protective devices. Asymmetry occurs to some degree in all three-phase faults since all phase currents cannot be 0 at the same time. Conversely, line-to-ground are mostly symmetric, since insulator failure or flashover usually occurs near voltage peaks (zero-current crossing for naturally reactive systems)[^1]. Here we'll talk about asymmetric currents out on the distribution system, far from a generator, so we won't be taking into account the generator subtransient, transient, and steady state impedances.

> Asymmetry occurs to some degree in __all three-phase__ faults since all three-phase currents cannot be 0 simultaneously.

The asymmetry, with respect to the zero axis of the sinusoidal current, arises from the need for currents and voltages to satisfy two rules:

1. Current must lag voltage by the system phase angle (90Â° for purely reactive systems)
2. Current cannot change instantaneously across an inductance (and both large conductors and large machines are inductive)

Asymmetrical current can be broken into both a purely symmetrical AC component and a purely aperiodic DC component. The AC component is symmetrical about the y-axis. The DC component is exponentially decaying with a time constant proportional to X/R. The initial magnitude of the DC current depends on the time of occurence due to the closing phase angle determined by the offset from the zero-crossing of the voltage waveform and the system phase angle, $$\theta=\tan^{-1}(X/R)$$.

Asymmetrical Current

:   $$ i_{asym}(t) = i_{dc}(t) + i_{ac}(t) $$

For the simplified case with no offset:

$$ i_{ac}(t) = \sqrt{2} I_{ac} sin(\omega t - \theta) $$

$$ i_{dc}(t) = I_{dc} e^{-\omega t R/X} $$

Here we can see the RMS value of the symmetrical waveform, $$ I_{ac} $$, and the starting value of the DC component, $$I_{dc}$$. Having no DC voltage to maintain it, the DC component decays with a time constant $$ \tau=\frac{X/R}{2\pi f} $$. R/X can be thought of as a damping coefficient for the DC current, since the time constant decreases with increased R (relative to X). Usually this value is given in X/R, where a larger value will cause a slower decay. IEEE/IEC standards use X/R $$=$$ 17 ($$\tau =$$ 45ms or ~2.7 cycles), which is relatively high for a distribution breaker, but X/R > 50 is not uncommon for a large generator[^2].

Since current cannot change instantaneously in a power system, 

$$
i_{asym}(t=0)=0 \\
\Rightarrow i_{dc}(0) = -i_{ac}(0)  \\
-\sqrt{2}I_{ac} \le I_{dc} \le \sqrt{2}I_{ac} \\
$$

For a sinusoidal wave with a DC offset of $$A_0$$ and a purely symmetric magnitude of $$A_1$$, the RMS value is equal to

$$ u_{RMS} = \sqrt{A_0^2 + \frac{A_1^2}{2}} $$[^3]

thus the maximum RMS value that the asymmetric fault current can obtain is 

$$ I_{max, asym} = \sqrt{I_{dc}^2 + I_{ac}^2} \\
= \sqrt{3} I_{dc} \\
= 1.732 \times I_{dc} \\
$$

Since in reality the DC component will decay during the first half cycle before the asymmetric current reaches its peak,

$$ I_{max,asym} \approx 1.6 $$

## Equation & Curve of Asymmetric Factor

The Asymmetry Factor, $$ \kappa $$, can be used to calculate the total asymmetric current from just the symmetric current and the X/R value of the system.


$$ \kappa := \frac{I_{asym}}{I_{ac}} \Rightarrow I_{asym} = \kappa I_{ac} $$

$$ I_{RMS, asym} = \sqrt{I_{dc}^2 + I_{ac}^2} \\
= \sqrt{(\sqrt{2}I_{ac}e^{-\omega tR/X})^2 + I_{ac}^2} \\
= I_{ac} \sqrt{1+2e^{-2\omega t R/X}}
$$

$$ \kappa(t,X,R,\omega) = \sqrt{1+2e^{-2\omega t R/X}} $$

And taking $$t=\text{half cycle}=1/120s $$ since the peak value of the asymmetric current occurs at this point ($$f=60Hz$$),

$$ \kappa(X,R) = \sqrt{1+2e^{-2\pi R/X}} $$
