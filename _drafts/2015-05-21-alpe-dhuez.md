I remember as a little kid, watching on television as the announcer enthusiastically kept mentioning this strange sounding word, "peloton". I became transfixed on the strategical maneuvers of this newfangled entity, made up of nothing more than grown men on bicycles. There was apparently a hierarchy of teams within this peloton and within these teams there were leaders, cyclists who were so remarkable in the hearts and minds of their colleagues that their kit-mates would lay a whole month-long bike race on the line so as to get their leader a few more minutes in the standings. 

The drama of the world's biggest cycling race mirrors the formidable Alps. As a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I had brought my bike overseas as I studied abroad in Paris, fantasizing of hammering pedal over pedal on the same roads helicopters pan cameras over every July. My dad was ecstatic to visit me and travel to Le Bourg d'Oisans, a small village near the L'Alpe D'Huez summit, one of the most famous climbs in the history of **le Tour**. Below is the route we did on the second day, halfway up to Huez and over to the formidable Col de Sarenne, which was at the time the most difficult bike ride I had been on, and certainly the most beautiful.
