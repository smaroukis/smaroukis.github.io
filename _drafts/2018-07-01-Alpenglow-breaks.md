5:40 am, Sacramento. Isaak is parked in his van, waiting outside my apartment. I am late, as usual. Internally, I justify my lateness,

> Unlike Isaak, who lives in a van, I have to get out of a bed with a plush, two inch mattress pad. Of course I’m f*cking late. Why do we have to wake up so early anyway?

I loaded up Isaak’s van with a backpack of camping gear and a sled. The sled was of the cheap, brightly colored variety that you find during the holiday season in bins at the front of the store. They are the type that no one actually really needs or wants, the type sure to last only a few runs, maybe less. But they are cheap and conveniently placed, so I bought one the day before at an electronics store.

I had met Isaak rock climbing at Phantom Spires the previous weekend, and through a mutual friend we had planned to climb Mount Shasta, the fifth highest peak in California (14,179 feet), and a straightfoward summit if the weather is right.

We hit the road from Sacramento with 4 hours ahead of us, but I didn’t offer to drive. There was something about taking responsibility of Isaak’s home that I didn’t quite feel ready for, and we had only met once prior. Plus I could catch up on some sleep-eye that I missed out on the night before. Not wanting to be dull, I stroke up some conversation which inevitably turned into a vanlife inquiry.

Isaak’s van setup is simple enough: the model is a Ford E-series, the classic plumber’s van; there’s a bed in the back where one can sleep diagonally; hard flooring and cabinets; a mini fridge and lots of books. 180 watts of solar panels power the fridge from a 12 volt battery, which can hold its own without solar for about a day or so. It wasn’t an idealized version of living out of a van that you might see online or on social media — it was just the bare necessities of life to keep one fed, sheltered, and — for Isaak — climbing.


My inquiry revealed that vanlife is not only about free spirits frolicking about in the great paved-by environments of the West, but also about trying to keep cool in the summer, keep warm in the winter, and find peace of mind in the form of a parking spot before hitting the ol’ sack. Isaak says the most stressful thing about living in his van was finding a safe place to park for the night.“The first year was hard,” Isaak says, “there’s places in Sacramento that definitely don’t feel safe to park in at night. In nicer neighborhoods people call the cops on you.” Uncomfortable to say the least. And this is coming from someone who wedges their hands into granite cracks for fun. Now though, he is relatively settled, with a famer’s consent to park on his land at night.

At some pause in the conversation I dozed off, later to wake up as we arrived in Redding to pick up Cliff, the last of our party. We switched vehicles to Cliff’s more fuel efficient and accomodating SUV. Then it was another hour to the town of Mount Shasta which sits at the base of the mountain, a town of transients and PCT’ers alike. At the gear shop in town I heard it is “pretty easy to tell them apart”. In my head I envisioned a gear-laden PCT hiker contrasted to a ragged and grizzled hitchiker sporting torn clothes.
