Half dome in Yosemite is the much proclaimed "hike you must do before you die". Although the hype is unprecedented, and the tourists abounding, the experience is nevertheless astounding. This was the longest hike I'd ever done at 18 miles over 12 hours. Luckily I was able to bring along my sister and my dad, having only told them I had applied and won the day-permit lottery less than 24 hours before we started at the Happy Isles trailhead. On the way down, I could hear my sister, a former diver at Michigan, saying that it was one of the hardest things she had ever done. So much for division 1 athletics.
