I will soon receive an International Minor for Engineers from the University of Michigan, which requires 4 semesters of language proficiency and 10 globally focused credits ranging from world economics to religion. I quickly finished my language requirements taking 3rd and 4th semester French as a Freshman and studying abroad as a Sophomore. Another year passed and I found myself two semesters away from graduating, with a nagging feeling in my soul. Influenced by Rolfe Potts' Vagabonding, having the desire to serve a community and live abroad, I decided to pursue something I had been thinking about for a while but had not dedicated the time and effort to - learning Japanese.

On the path of learning anything, it is important to surround oneself with motivation and support. Unfortunately it was October, and the Japanese class at Michigan spans a whole year. So I decided to teach myself with the hopes of testing into the second semester class in January. The rest of this post describes the tools and system I used. (Update: I made it.)

My first step was setting a schedule and then getting a system in place for learning, week by week. One of the greatest language learning and memory resources is Anki. Anki has a strong community of developers and language learners, and is also used by many medical students. 

There are a ton of Japanese language learning resources out there. The takeaways from scouring many of them are: 

master hiragana and katakana, NO ROMANI ALLOWED
use the Genki textbooks for easy to understand grammar and great illustrations
learn kanji starting with simple strokes first, learning radicals and mnemonics to build upon for future complex characters
use SRS and Anki for recall

## TOOLS I'M USING
- Genki I (Textbook and Audio) for grammar and vocab
### Anki Shared Decks
- [Genki I Grammar (through Chapter 6)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1758197267)
- [Genki Vocab by Chapter](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/942922371)
- [KanjiDamage Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/748570187)
### Anki Add-ons
- [Awesome TTS](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/301952613) - for adding speech to Japanese characters
- [Create Copy of Selected Cards](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/787914845)
- Japanese Support - generates bulk readings and furigana
- [Jisho.org](http://jisho.org) (for Mac users: even better is the Alfred Jisho [workflow](https://github.com/janclarin/jisho-alfred-workflow) that I found - Japanese vocab is literally a hotkey away)
- [Japanese for Busy People Kana Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Busy-People-Kana-Workbook/dp/1568364016/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=MQYK016RGC4KD5E5TRX6) - to master hiragana, katakana and subtleties of pronunciation (and those tricky nasal consonants)
- [HiNative](https://hinative.com) - to ask random quick questions on language, culture, or pronunciation
- [Lang8](http://lang-8.com) - for proofreading essays or longer passages

## RECALL VS. RECOGNITION - ADDING THE POSSIBILITY OF REVERSED CARDS IN ANKI
For the Anki Genki Vocab deck, I made the following changes

1) Added in a "Mnemonic" field for hard to remember words

2) Made the "Recall" card type optional, not prompting with English until I wanted to practice recall later down the line (I believe I can learn a larger amount of vocab faster this way). 

For #2 I had to make the following edits, which is a good way to have the optional-reversed functionality that you see in some of Anki's default card types. 

Click on Browse, go to the Genki Vocab deck and click "Fields", adding a field titled "Add Reversed" (spelling is important). After this go into "Cards" on the current deck where you should see the Recognition and Recall card types. To keep the Recall card types as optional for the future, add in the following tag around the displayed content:

```markdown
{% raw %}{{# Add Reversed}}...{{/Add Reversed}}{% endraw %}
```
